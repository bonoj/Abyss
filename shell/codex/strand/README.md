# Strand — temperate emergence

**Run:** [Strand in Shell](https://bonoj.github.io/Abyss/shell/?world=strand) · **Composition:** [world.js](world.js) · **Chronicle:** [CHRONICLE.md](CHRONICLE.md) · **Physics/material SST:** [Arcana CONTACTS](../../arcana/physics/CONTACTS.md) · **Archived historical notes:** [README.ARCHIVE.md](README.ARCHIVE.md)

**Parent entrypoints:** [Abyss README](../../../README.md) · [Shell HANDOFF](../../HANDOFF.md) · [Gate](https://github.com/bonoj/Gate/blob/main/README.md) / [Sanctum CONTRACT](https://github.com/bonoj/Sanctum/blob/main/CONTRACT.md).

## Intent and invariants

Ancient temperate world inside the existing Hermeticon: credible weathered geology, masonry, material, roots, vegetation and atmosphere, composed as interacting systems rather than disconnected decoration.

- Reuse Arcana's vessel, authoritative `createTerrain({topology:'atlas'})`, signed occupancy, geological material/provenance lookup and terrain mutations. Positive occupancy is **not** metric distance.
- All existing Strand terrain responds as **stone** for initial collisions without rewriting geological substrate IDs, strata or deposited lineage. The [CONTACTS SST](../../arcana/physics/CONTACTS.md) owns all shared physics/material rules.
- Preserve existing meteor, debris, impact, survey and equatorial-edge behavior. Protect Genesis, Entropy, Europa and Wanderer; Strand remains opt-in.
- Preserve Stone & Root brick visual geometry. Physics owns body state; rendering is a view. Avoid O(N²) collision scans and heavyweight per-BB solvers.
- Separate source commits, test results, Pages publication, and actual browser verification. Do not claim settling or performance without measurements.

## Current composition (source read 2026-11-03)

`world.js` mounts Hermeticon, atlas terrain, equatorial treatment, neutral `strand-geology.js`, `brick-rain.js`, bead debris, impact dispatcher, Cinderfall and material survey. `world.update(dt)` advances meteor, debris and bricks. Earlier `temperate-landscape.js`, isolated material specimen and Orbital Foundry are historical/unmounted experiments, not current runtime features.

`brick-rain.js` now uses [`stone-contacts.js`](../../arcana/physics/stone-contacts.js): fixed 120 Hz steps, local spatial bins, iterative terrain/brick impulses, angular friction and preliminary sleep/wake. **Committed and read back, but browser behavior and stable resting piles remain unverified.** The implementation is not yet the persistent multipoint manifold solver described in CONTACTS.

## Development cadence (mandatory)

**Implement → Chronicle update → README update + handoff → cleanup.**

1. **Implement:** inspect source/contracts, make a reversible change, read back commits and validate what can actually be tested.
2. **Chronicle:** append a heading with the **actual UTC ISO 8601 timestamp** (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ`); record objective, changes/SHAs, evidence, risks, next action and rollback. Never invent timestamps for old entries.
3. **README + handoff:** update only current composition, verified status, links, and the next actionable task. Keep this README compact.
4. **Cleanup:** remove stale current-state assertions and redundant prose; archive incidental/superseded material in [README.ARCHIVE.md](README.ARCHIVE.md), not Chronicle. Verify links, imports and no unintended world changes.

## Next handoff

**Next action:** observe and instrument the actual 72-brick fall/settle on Strand's stone hills and mesas; then implement accurate terrain separation, persistent multipoint contacts and robust sleeping islands. Record measured contact count, penetration, awake bodies, solver cost and browser outcome before declaring success.

**Cold boot order:** this README → [Chronicle](CHRONICLE.md) → [CONTACTS SST](../../arcana/physics/CONTACTS.md) → [world.js](world.js) → [brick-rain.js](brick-rain.js) → [stone-contacts.js](../../arcana/physics/stone-contacts.js) → [terrain.js](../../arcana/terrain.js). Inspect actual branch head and Pages/build metadata; preserve rollback and use [Gate](https://github.com/bonoj/Gate/blob/main/README.md) / [Sanctum CONTRACT](https://github.com/bonoj/Sanctum/blob/main/CONTRACT.md) on recoverable write failures.
